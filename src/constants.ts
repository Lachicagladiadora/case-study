This will dramatically reduce your electric bill and save money throughout your solar panels' lifetime. Our average customer generates between 25% and 45% return on investment from solar panels. Solar is a real investment where you’ll enjoy significant gains over time.",
              "Solar Power is Cleaner – Most electricity comes from hydroelectric, nuclear, and natural gas sources. The grid is inefficient, and there’s a significant loss between the plants and your home or business. The grid is also unreliable, with blackouts and outages being common. Solar power is carbon-free, and panels' output over time can offset any pollution created during production. Solar power is far more efficient, especially when installing a battery backup system. Solar panels are the obvious choice if you want the cleanest and greenest energy for your home or business.",

Battery storage will make any system even more efficient and reliable, providing emergency backup or a source of electricity during the evenings. When the grid goes down, solar keeps working.
